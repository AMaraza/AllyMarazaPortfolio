                <p class="project-description">Crabitat Combo is a 2-5 player, self published party card game. It's a multifaceted project that covers aspects of game design, systems design, project management, marketing, and production.</p>
                <p class="project-description">Parts of the Adobe Suite of products such as InDesign and Photoshop were used for card designs. Spreadsheet programs were used for game balancing and tracking. Throughout the prototype process, I was consistently utilizing printing services such as The Game Crafter, following their proofing templates and printing guidelines.</p>
                <p class="project-description">This project also gave me an extensive lesson in producing physical goods through working with an oversees factory to mass produce the game, also dealing with the legal requirements associated with overseas production. The project was also a strong lesson in marketing as I built up a social media presence, and attended conventions.</p>
