                <h3>Learning Pico 8 & The Game Jam</h3>
                <p>I wanted to experiment with some tools I hadn't used before, so when I found a game jam theme I liked, I decided to use Pico 8 to make it. I was intrigued by the limitations of the engine and was curious how they would test my creativity.</p>
                <p>From the time I joined the game jam, to the submission window was about 5 days. I spent the first two days learning how to use the editor, following the Youtube playlist from Space Cat. I learned the basics of Lua, the built in functions for Updating and Drawing, how to use the sprite system, and the sound editor.</p>
                <p>The game jam's theme was "under pressure" and I took a very literal approach making an arcade style game about managing pressure in old rusty pipes. This simple concept not only has the player managing pressure, but the fast difficulty curve puts the player themself under pressure.</p>

                <h3>Limitations of Pico 8 and Lua Peaked my Creativity and Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>Pico 8 is a fantasy game console with many built in limitations. You're limited to about 8,000 words of code, 255 sprites, 16 colors, and the built in sound editor. Lua is also a language without many built in features as the language itself only has 23 keywords.</p>
                <p>The code limitation was my favorite limitation to work around. Being restricted to 8,000 words of code made me reflect on every line that I wrote and how I could make it cleaner. I found myself more inclined to find ways to make code reusable, and modular so as to not write too much.</p>
                <p>I also adapted to the limited nature of Lua, primarily in utilizing tables. Tables in Lua can be used similar to objects in Javascript, and this made for a perfect pseudo class system. Each pipe, the player, the pressure wheels, broken pipes, etc each had their own table with reusable variables to save on code complexity and length.</p>
                <p>I don't usually have a large focus on game art as I think of myself as more of a programmer. However, the limitations of the color palette, and the wonderful implementation of pico 8's sprite maker, I found myself being more creative than ever with my sprites. Not having to worry about an external tool, and having only 16 colors made it easier to understand concepts of sprite sizes, and shading.</p>

                <h3>Built Core Game Systems Such as Collisions From Scratch</h3>
                <p>While Pico 8 has many functions for you for drawing sprites, managing input, playing sounds, there are a lot of features that aren't. </p>
                <p>While each card type had it's own color, there was a little mismatch in how they were portrayed. All passive cards were cool colors, however, the Combo Cards, another passive card, was a warm color. The only other warm colored cards were the Ability Cards which act as effects such as turn skips. So color changes were made to ensure cohesion.</p>
                <p>The original bright bold colors and logo were solid, but it felt out of place for the other design pillar of Hermit Crab Care. So to create a better fit, the colors were toned down to more earthy colors, and the logo was redesigned to a more cutesy, less bold looking hermit crab.</p>
                <p>I want to mention my wonderful artist Isabelle Pelletier who I commisioned for all the current artwork used in the game. She has helped me give my game a very pleasing and adorable identity. Her work is seen in the logo, the box design, the individual hermit crabs, and new backgrounds for the different card types to make them more lively and interesting to look at.</p>
