                <p>Crabitat Combo was built around two core goals: creating a fast-paced, easy-to-learn party game, and incorporating real facts about proper hermit crab care. While the mechanics evolved significantly over several years, these guiding principles remained constant throughout development.</p>
                <p>The original design used a point-based system, where players earned points by placing habitat item cards and forming matching combos. Action cards added interaction by allowing players to disrupt others. This foundation established the game’s competitive and social nature, but playtesting revealed issues with deck size and game length.</p>
                <p>To iterate quickly, I ran playtests both digitally using Tabletop Simulator and with printed prototypes. Feedback from each session informed the next revision, and I tracked deck composition and balance changes in spreadsheets to better understand how adjustments affected gameplay.</p>
                <p>A major turning point came when I replaced the point-based system with a progress-based win condition. This allowed games to end naturally based on player actions rather than waiting for the deck to run out, reducing average playtime and simplifying balance decisions.</p>
                <p>Another key improvement was allowing certain actions to be performed freely instead of consuming a turn. This gave players more flexibility, increased interaction, and reduced downtime. These changes allowed me to reduce the deck size from over 120 cards to 95, and shortened the average game length from 45–60 minutes to 25–35 minutes, with some games finishing even faster.</p>
