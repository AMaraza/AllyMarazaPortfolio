                <p>Crabitat Combo was built around two core goals: creating a fast-paced, easy-to-learn party game, and incorporating real facts about proper hermit crab care. While the mechanics evolved significantly over several years, these guiding principles remained constant throughout development.</p>
                <p>The original design used a point-based system, where players earned points by placing habitat item cards and forming matching combos. Action cards added interaction by allowing players to disrupt others. This foundation established the game’s competitive and social nature, but playtesting revealed issues with deck size and game length.</p>
                <p>To iterate quickly, I ran playtests both digitally using Tabletop Simulator and with printed prototypes. Feedback from each session informed the next revision, and I tracked deck composition and balance changes in spreadsheets to better understand how adjustments affected gameplay.</p>
                <p>A major turning point came when I replaced the point-based system with a progress-based win condition. This allowed games to end naturally based on player actions rather than waiting for the deck to run out, reducing average playtime and simplifying balance decisions.</p>
                <p>Another key improvement was allowing certain actions to be performed freely instead of consuming a turn. This gave players more flexibility, increased interaction, and reduced downtime. These changes allowed me to reduce the deck size from over 120 cards to 95, and shortened the average game length from 45–60 minutes to 25–35 minutes, with some games finishing even faster.</p>

                <p>Crabitat Combo was one of the fastest projects for me to get off the ground thanks to an abundance of easy to use digital tools. Within a day of drafting the initial concept and rulebook, I used tabletop simulator's built in custom cards to get a working prototype up and running. For most of the game's early development, this is what I would use to rapidly iterate the game. It wasn't without its flaws however as I was limited to who I could find available online to test, as well as make sure those people owned Tabletop Simulator which unfortunately is not a free tool. This is when I started to switch to physical prototypes.</p>
                <p>Initially, all physical copies of the game were hand printed, and cut, and put into card sleeves. This opened up my ability to playtest to all different types of places, with many different types of players. Almost everywhere I went I would make sure to have a copy on me in the event I'd be able to run a playtest and get some valuable feedback for the next iteration.</p>
                <p>Once the game started reaching a more complete state, I began using a Print on Demand website called The Game Crafter. They provide many components, and all you need to do is upload your images, proof them with the provided proofing overlays, and order as few as 1 copy, or you could even order in bulk. This really helped in giving the game a more complete, professional look which made it more appealing to take to places such as conventions, and overall helped playtesters take the game more seriously.</p>
                <p>One pitfall I did find with this method however was that it would often take about 1 month for the copies to arrive, so if I had made some major change such as removing points from the game, then the copy that was still in production or shipping would immediately be obsolete. Despite this, I found it the easiest and most cost effective way to get professional looking prototypes.</p>

                <p>Once I had moved past the basic black text on white backgrounds, I had a relatively consistent design idea in mind for the art direction and overall aesthetic of the game. I wanted it to be colorful, playful, and I wanted it to be easy to understand. This was done by making each card type its own color, and the initial colors were bold, and vibrant. The overall look of the game didn't change much from this concept for a while, and the original logo I had for the game reflected it perfectly. While there was nothing wrong with the style, it definitely needed some updates.</p>
                <p>While each card type had it's own color, there was a little mismatch in how they were portrayed. Crabitat Cards were a cool color, as were Hermit Crabs, and Aquarium Cards. However, the Combo Cards, a card that directly relates to the Crabitat Cards was a warm color. The only other warm color were the Ability Cards which act as effects you place on other players such as turn skips. So there was an important change of Combo Cards to blue so that they were cool along with the other placeable cards.</p>
                <p>While the original bright bold colors and logo were good, and seemed to fit the party game aspect well, it didn't really fit the other pillar of the game's design which is kind of like conservation in a way, with the way the game promotes proper hermit crab care. So to better match, the colors were toned down to more earthy colors, and the logo was redesigned to a more cutesy, less bold looking hermit crab. It was around this time I also made changes to the way the cards were laid out, adding borders, and dividers to make cards more appealing to look at.</p>
                <p>I want to mention my wonderful artist Isabelle Pelletier who I commisioned for all the current artwork used in the game. She has helped me give my game a very pleasing and adorable identity. Her work is seen in the logo, the box design, the individual hermit crabs, and most recently has done amazing work giving the cards more life such as a grassy background for the Crabitat Cards, and aggressive looking claws on the Ability Cards.</p>

                <p>Running the crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter was both the most challenging and most rewarding part of this project. It required learning an entirely new skillset, including how to present the game clearly, communicate its value, and reach an audience beyond my existing network.</p>
                <p>To build awareness leading up to launch, I showcased Crabitat Combo at several Central Florida conventions, including Anime Festival Orlando, Holiday Matsuri, and Quest Con Orlando. These events provided valuable opportunities to playtest the game with new audiences, gather feedback, and build interest ahead of the campaign.</p>
                <p>After months of preparation and promotion, the campaign launched in February 2025 and reached its funding goal in just 12 hours. Since then, I have been working closely with my overseas manufacturer, LongPack Games, to prepare the game for full production and fulfillment.</p>
                <p>This process has involved preparing print-ready files using Adobe InDesign, reviewing proofing overlays, and learning the logistics of manufacturing and international fulfillment. Through this experience, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of the full production pipeline required to bring a physical product from concept to reality.</p>
                <p>I know my portfolio is meant to be a place to talk about my experience and what I've learned and done with my projects, but I want to mention my hundreds of playtesters, my artist, and all those who helped to support me through this undertaking. This project would not have come this far without them.</p>
